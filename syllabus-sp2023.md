## Deliverables

__NOTE:__ All submissions should be in __Jupyter Notebooks__.

<!--__NOTE:__ Please check each week's schedule/checklist frequently for important dates and other information.-->

### Mini-projects:

There are __two (2)__ mini-projects in this course. Although each mini-project is a *complete* data mining process, they focus on different aspects of it. These are designed to provide you with opportunities to internalize as well as apply the materials discussed during the class sessions and related practices.

Each mini-project has __three (3)__ parts - these parts will be made available along this course, please pay attention to **Google Classroom**.

It is expected that you __collaborate__ with your peers - but you still need to put in your best *individual* effort in the mini projects.

For each part, I have provided ONE __checkpoint opportunity__ for you so I can check on your work and provide feedback – you can submit your draft on Google Classroom. I will __NOT__ grade on your draft work. The checkpoint is the _Monday_ in the following week the respective part is released. Please notify me on Slack if you decide to utilize this opportunity.


Completed notebooks should be submitted to Google Classroom. __No email submission will be accepted.__

### Course Projects

There will be __two (2)__ course projects during the course. Both projects reflects how machine learning is practiced in the real world. *A peer evaluation system is designed to evaluate the individual performances within groups*.

<!---__Note__ that all groups' performances are ranked - the groups ranked top 3 in class are rewarded with extra points: 

+ First place: 20 extra points
+ Second place: 10 extra points
+ Third place: 5 extra points -->

__Project #1: Advanced Preparation of Financial Data.__ The first project focuses on **data preprocessing** (including data understanding), which is an important, maybe the most time consuming step in any machine learning project. This is a group-based project. _Advanced modeling techniques, and novel data preprocessing steps will be rewarded with extra points._  Detailed rules and guidelines will be made available to you later. There are **TWO** deliverables in this project:

+ _Milestone Report_: This is the report that you present the initial descriptive statistics, data visualizations, and other data understanding results. These would be the foundation for you to select different data pre-processing strategies, which should be included as *a plan* in this report as well. Formatting and writing styles are recommended, but NOT required in this report.
+ _Final Results Report_: This is the report in which you present the final (preprocessing & modeling) results, including the final descriptive statistics, data visualizations, imputation technique and results, normalization technique and results, correlation analysis results, standardization results, recoding technique and results, and other important information. The modeling part is completed using the **evaluation code** provided by the instructor. <!--All formatting and other guidelines __should__ be observed.-->

__Project #2: Machine Learning Applications__. This project covers all stages in a machine learning process. Decision on the topic will be made further into the semester, based on the availability of the required dataset. You will be using Jupyter to complete the machine learning tasks for solving the business problem. *Advanced modeling techniques, and presentation skills will be rewarded with extra points*. There are four required deliverables for this project: 
+ _Project Proposal_: a written deliverable indicating the business problem you selected, the rationale for selection, and the plan for the project; 
+ _Data Audit Report_: providing the rationale and results of variable selection (using correlation matrix, and other tools), as well as the data transformation/standardization, imputation, and other data preparation steps. At least **THREE** data preprocessing techniques are required at this stage;
+ _Initial Data Models_: provide the initial data models created for this project – all appropriate modeling techniques should be attempted at this stage (e.g., decision tree, k-NN, ANN, SVM, and regression models). The evaluation metrics (e.g., ROC, AUC, accuracy, precision, recall) need to be reported here for comparing the models;
+ _Final Report and Presentation_: providing a written summary and interpretation of your final model(s), and present them in class in front of the “client”.

More details to come later in the semester.

## Attendance and Class Participation

Learning will become much more informative and interesting through lively discussions and exchanges of ide-as/experiences during the class sessions. As such, students are expected to attend every class meeting. Successful class at-tendances, participations, and discussions, imply: 

__Attendance and Note Taking__: Attend each and every class in a timely manner. Be aware that some of the material dis-cussed in class will NOT be covered in the textbook, but will often appear in the exams. You will need to submit exer-cise files after most of the classes. Of course, I realize that in some cases unforeseeable emergencies arise. If you need to miss class for a legitimate, predictable reason, you must inform me and also take the initiative as early as possible to mitigate the effects of that absence. For example, you should establish a buddy system and ask another peer to take notes, handouts for you. You should find out what took place in the class prior to your next class attendance.

__Flipped Classroom__: This course follows a _flipped classroom_ manner. Which means the lectures (e.g. in _recorded videos_) will be released to you __prior__ to every schedule class meeting. It is __mandatory__ for you to watch the class videos prior to the class meetings. The actual class meeting will be mainly for course work (e.g. exercises, Q&As, group work). In order for this model to work, it is crucial for you to come in __prepared__. Refer to the __preparations__ item for more details.

__Preparations__: To contribute to class discussions, you must spend adequate time prior to class preparing carefully all required tasks (e.g., readings, assignments). Please take your own laptop – meeting the minimum hardware and software rquirements to every class meeting time – this is __mandatory__!

<!--__Special Note for Spring 2021__: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, No in-person meeting is held until notified otherwise. You are expected to follow the _flipped classroom_ model (described below). And if you need help for your course work (e.g., exercises, Q&As, group work), contact Ms. Yue (for technical support of Colab/Slack), your Python tutors (for course related questions), or myself for assistance.-->


__Note Taking__: While you are watching the class lectures, make sure you take notes. A separate presentation file will be provided to you via _Google Classroom_ for you to take notes. In most of the lecture notebooks, there are some exercise questions. You will need to submit exercise files after most of the classes. We will use a _buddy system_ in which students form 2-3 people groups for comparing notes and codes.

__Contributing in Class Discussions__: If you are in class and are well prepared, the next key step is to contribute ideas. While this may seem difficult at first, asking questions helps your classmates as well as you in clarifying concepts and overall understanding. Each of you will eventually be working in some organization where collaboration and discussions will be es-sential to problem solving in some business domain. Consider classroom discussion in the same spirit and participate! You should consider asking/answering questions in our Slack channel ``data6545`` as the __main__ channel of class communication.


__Respect and Dignity__: It is also important for each of us as individuals to respect each other. Treat your classmates with respect and dignity (I like to call this R&D). Listen carefully to the questions and comments while keeping an open mind for ideas. It is okay to disagree with certain viewpoints, but present your arguments in a courteous manner. Negative body lan-guage such as rolling your eyes, using phrases such as “that was a dumb idea”, or interrupting others to express disagreements runs counter to the spirit of positive learning environment and is not okay. At the end of the day, we would like to create a positive environment that is conducive to learning.

__Professionalism__: As budding professionals and business majors, conduct yourself in a professional manner just as you would with an employer or colleague. Refrain for unprofessional behaviors such as arriving late to class, coming in and out of class, taking a nap in class, making unprofessional comments to other students and the instructor, and sending unprofessional comments. Out of respect for fellow students, all mobile communication and entertainment devices need to be turned off and kept off during the class. Only software tools required for the class (e.g. Google Colab, Zoom) or note taking software (e.g., Evernote) the class time.

---

## Other Course Policies

__Computer and Lab__: You will have to bring in a laptop for every class in order to complete the in-class tutorials. It is your responsibility to make sure that your laptop is up-to-date so that it runs the system smoothly. You will need to have access to a Jupyter environment to complete the course work - fail to do so will lead to failing the course.

__Course Materials__: All the teaching materials, including assignments and exams, are the intellectual properties of Fairfield University – distributing such materials without written approval is **strongly prohibited**.

__Late Submissions__: Grades become official one week after assignments/exams have been returned by the instructor. Late submissions might be accepted with a 10% grade penalty. <!--If you miss an exam, you may be given a make-up exam if you provide a written official excuse, such as a doctor’s note covering the date the quiz is given. Oral excuses are not acceptable.--> No make-up opportunities would be given to final deliverables of both projects.

__Class Communications and Feedbacks__: We will use __Slack__ for __all__ course communications. __DO NOT SEND EMAIL TO YOUR PROFESSORS. DM instead.__ You will receive an email invitation from ``Yue.Pu@fairfield.edu`` with instructions. You need to join the ``#data6545`` channel to communicate with me and the class. Normally, I would reply to your DM no longer than __12__ hours. Allow more time during weekends and holidays. Feedbacks on your assignments/deliverables will generally be returned to your within a week after the due of the assignment. After receiving the feedback (and grade), you have __three (3)__ days to dispute a grade with proper justified reasons. 

__Academic Honesty__: Fairfield University’s primary purpose is the pursuit of academic excellence. All members of the Fairfield University community share responsibility for establishing and maintaining appropriate standards of academic honesty and integrity. This is possible only in an atmosphere where discovery and communication of knowledge are marked by scrupulous, unqualified honesty. In the event of such dishonesty, professors are to award a grade of zero for the project, paper, or examination in question, and may record an F for the course itself.

__Students with Disabilities__: Fairfield University is committed to providing qualified students with disabilities an equal opportunity to access the benefits, rights and privileges of its services, programs and activities, in an accessible setting. Fur-thermore, in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Connecticut State laws, we provide reasonable accommodations to qualified students, to reduce the impact of disabilities on academic functioning or upon other major life activities. 

__Online Office/Coaching Hours__: online office hours are available via [Zoom](https://fairfield.zoom.us/j/9579872640), which runs in addition to the regular on ground office hours. If needed, additional coaching hours can be arranged.

__Python Tutoring__: Given the circumstances that the professor is not available, we have Python tutors for on-ground and online tutoring services. Make sure to maintain contacts with your Python tutor(s).
